8/7/15, 10:43 PM - ‪+91 78668 40245‬: Sharing my Friends Idea. 

I hav a new idea to pay tribute to the great kalam sir.
Atleast every1 should google his name on "8-August-2015" so that he becomes the most searched man in history. Earlier same kind of incident occured.
Steve Jobs,founder of apple is the most searched man in a single day.Some millions searches were made on the day after his death.
So if we 125 crore Indians will google apj abdul kalam sir then that will a new and of course last record of his.

Before ignoring this msg pls think ,
u Google everyday. Jus type his name
 that's not that difficult...😎😎

Forward it to all ur groups!

(Birth Day of Ramanujam),

See this Absolutely amazing Mathematics !

1 x 8 + 1 = 9
12 x 8 + 2 = 98
123 x 8 + 3 = 987
1234 x 8 + 4 = 9876
12345 x 8 + 5 = 98765
123456 x 8 + 6 = 987654
1234567 x 8 + 7 = 9876543
12345678 x 8 + 8 = 98765432
123456789 x 8 + 9 = 987654321

1 x 9 + 2 = 11
12 x 9 + 3 = 111
123 x 9 + 4 = 1111
1234 x 9 + 5 = 11111
12345 x 9 + 6 = 111111
123456 x 9 + 7 = 1111111
1234567 x 9 + 8 = 11111111
12345678 x 9 + 9 = 111111111
123456789 x 9 +10= 1111111111

9 x 9 + 7 = 88
98 x 9 + 6 = 888
987 x 9 + 5 = 8888

9876543 x 9 + 1 = 88888888
98765432 x 9 + 0 = 888888888

Brilliant, isn't it?

And look at this symmetry :
1 x 1 = 1
11 x 11 = 121
111 x 111 = 12321
1111 x 1111 = 1234321
11111 x 11111 = 123454321
111111 x 111111 = 12345654321
1111111 x 1111111 = 1234567654321
11111111 x 11111111 = 123456787654321
111111111 x 111111111 = 12345678987654321

Brilliant isn't it?

8/14/15, 9:10 PM - Moulee: P.S: plzz infrm evryone... Also Online Test will be conducted by HackerRank logistics team. Questions will be based mainly on aptitude and coding and compilation will be done online. Now most of you might not have much experience about programming in online ide. So plzz go to hackerrank website and get an idea. Very much similar to code vite. Also there will be various other aspects which i hv listed below:
1) use int main() rather than void main() and do return 0;
2) Your code may not pass all the tests so instead of getting disappointed 
try to switch to other question. You can take care of the remaining test later.
3) You can use custom input while debugging. Custom input means you will be sending iinput rather than the server.
4) Input and output format should exactly match the examples which will be given. So don't give unnecesary prompts (like enter number and all). Use scanf() directly. Also don't give unnecessary spaces.
5) Check constraints. some of the test cases may have variables which can be around 10^10 long and even more. In that case use long int, float, double, long double,etc. Ofcourse while printing u hv to use tricks like precision specifier to display the value as int rather than double or float (e.g: printf("%.0f",value); ) Java user can use BigNumber for numbers larger than 10^10.
6) Some results may be out of time limit error. In that case you have to optimise (i.e. use better searching and sorting algorithms like quicksort() for sorting,binarysearch() for searching, and heapify() for finding the max element,etc). Its better if u can use java coz there are inbuilt functions in java and u need not write the sorting and searching algorithms.

9/15/15, 11:41 PM - Soumya: Kal ke hokkolorb er 1 yr purti hobe..and for that cause there will be several cultural events that will be held in campus..

9/16/15, 12:02 PM - Anurag: MD r class E1-1 e
9/16/15, 12:06 PM - Moulee: Ok
9/16/15, 7:03 PM - Shilpa: I had talked to hod today
9/16/15, 7:05 PM - Shilpa: I requested him to postpone the midsems of those who failed in the 1st week of November. He asked us to request our respective teachers about postponing the midsems.
9/16/15, 7:06 PM - Shilpa: Now,it is a question whether the teachers will agree or not.
9/16/15, 7:07 PM - Shilpa: If those who failed requested them altogether,I think it would be more effective.
9/16/15, 7:08 PM - Shilpa: So I request all of those who have got supples,please let us act in a group.
9/16/15, 8:02 PM - Pratham Mani: i don't think all teachers will agree
9/16/15, 8:03 PM - Pratham Mani: smb sir has told he will necessarily take the xam before puja
9/16/15, 8:03 PM - Pratham Mani: and he will take one single xam, for all
9/16/15, 8:05 PM - Shilpa: 😢
9/16/15, 8:05 PM - Pratham Mani: som if there is no xam on that very day, as of his cls test , thats 10th oct, then he will take the test on that day, if there is an xam  on 10th, then he may prepone or postpone it by a week, depending on the condition
9/16/15, 8:06 PM - Shilpa: No preponing
9/16/15, 8:14 PM - Pratham Mani: see if even some teachers agree to postpone, it will still be of sum help, postponing the whole midsem wk isn't a very good and practical idea, as neither all teachers, nor many students would agree, as there are sum problems too if we give midsems after puja, sessional er onk jhamela thakbe, teacherra  bigger syllabus debe, emni tei sem ebr age, ar tar sathe pujar somoy chap thakbe
9/16/15, 8:15 PM - Shilpa: Not all students
9/16/15, 8:15 PM - Pratham Mani: preponing or postponing is not ur decision, it will be sir's decision
9/16/15, 8:15 PM - Pratham Mani: what not all students
9/16/15, 8:15 PM - Shilpa: I m talking about students who have supples
9/16/15, 8:16 PM - Shilpa: Only
9/16/15, 8:16 PM - Shilpa: They should surely agree
9/16/15, 8:16 PM - Pratham Mani: are many teachers are in favour of taking a single xam
9/16/15, 8:16 PM - Pratham Mani: not necessarily,  even i am not in support of postponing whole midsem wk
9/16/15, 8:17 PM - Shilpa: U have a single field theory
9/16/15, 8:17 PM - Pratham Mani: many people have single supples, they won't agree
9/16/15, 8:17 PM - Shilpa: But there r students who have 2 or even more difficult supples to clear
9/16/15, 8:18 PM - Pratham Mani: u can ask them, if they agree , fine, u can give midsems on other dates
9/16/15, 8:18 PM - Shilpa: I think it would be better if midsems get postponed to nov
9/16/15, 8:19 PM - Shilpa: At least I will be benifitted nd so would d students who hav many supples
9/16/15, 8:19 PM - Pratham Mani: that won't happen to the whole midsem, its decided by the teachers, don't u understand
9/16/15, 8:20 PM - Pratham Mani: its not in our hands
9/16/15, 8:20 PM - Shilpa: Let's see
9/16/15, 8:20 PM - Shilpa: What happens?
9/16/15, 8:20 PM - Pratham Mani: so, who among us agree, is a very 2nd criteria

10/24/15, 10:56 AM - Soumya: An Appeal for Help- Cancer Patient Rishab Ghosh, a student of Jadavpur University    
Your generous donation can save the life of a cancer patient, Rishab Ghosh, a 2nd year electrical engineering student of Jadavpur University who was diagnosed with Mediastinal Non-Seminomatous Germ cell Tumor in July, 2014. The continuation of his life and studies critically depend now on further cancer treatment and Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) that crucially relies on your financial support. As you may know, BMT is very expensive. Rishab does not have HLA matched sibling donor so the best option for him would be to undergo haploidential transplant from his father. At CMC Vellore estimated cost for this approximately Rs. 25,00,000. Unfortunately, his parents are poor; he is continuing his studies through a Fellowship from Foundation for Excellence, a California based organization through Bangalore and Vivekananda Scholarship from the State and Central Governments of India. For medical expenses, he depends on relatives, friends and different organizations. Rishab’s physical condition is deteriorating day by day, yet his BMT is being delayed as treatment can be started only after full payment of the treatment. Please spread your helping hand as early as possible.  Please place your donation to the following account :  
Name: Asish Ghosh 
Bank: Union Bank of India
 Branch: Bankura Branch 
Account No.: 608402010003581 
IFSC Code: UBIN0560847
 MICR Code: 722026002  
you may also donate over the crowdfunding  website, https://www.youcaring.com/rishab-ghosh-432761 managed by Rishab’s family. Other  details of his treatment is also available there.  Your support to battle against Rishab’s  cancer is appreciated. 
 From: Family, Friends and Teachers of Rishab Ghosh and JU community   P.S.: For any enquiry please contact at this phone number (9434393493/8653765893) and email: shankhajit8@gmail.com

For the first time in PARIDHI, megatronix is introducing a seminar on “Entrepreneurship, A Roadmap to Start-ups”, for budding business leaders who dream to be a freelancer. 
Headstart Foundation in collaboration with Megatronix is presenting the seminar where you will get a chance to meet and interact with business icons who would deliver the idea of how to start your own venture on your own terms.
Just not only that, if you have any business idea, maybe small, maybe big, maybe un-polished, or maybe well planned, bring it to us and get it reviewed by the business icons. Also the best among them would get the chance to meet investors and mentors , along with a certificate and a small gift as a token of appreciation. 
Come and be a part of it. 
The registration is free of cost!
Limited seats.

3/4/16, 7:12 PM - Anurag: Everyone please take note:A plant visit has been organized for both sections A and B on 19th March to cover a portion of syllabus included in the utilization part.Contact Pranabesh Bala for details.
3/4/16, 7:54 PM - Anurag: Everyone please pay ATTENTION. The placement coordinator from our section HAS to be decided within the next week.Abir Da himself will be empowering and handing over the charge to the new PC.As far as I know,A section has already come up with a name for a PC so we need to act quick.
Firstly, the PC will have a lot of work at hand and will have to stay back at the placement cell till even 9 PK sometimes.
Secondly,good communication skills are necessary.
Thirdly, he should not be too busy in preparing for any other examination like GATE or CAT or GRE.
So students if you think you're responsible enough to to hold such a post speak up.Please do suggest some names who in your opinion will be good enough for this important post.
3/4/16, 7:56 PM - Sanchayan: A sec e ke hochhe?

At cash Counter, she opened her Purse to pay. The cashier noticed a TV Remote in her Purse. He couldn't control his curiosity, and asked, "Do you always carry your TV remote with you...?"
She replied, "No, not always... But my Husband refused to accompany me for shopping today...!"
Moral : 
Accompany your Wife...! 
😡😝😄😄
The story continues...
The shopkeeper laughs, and takes back all the items that lady had purchased...
Shocked at this act, she asks the shopkeeper what he was doing.
He said, "Your husband has BLOCKED your credit card...!"
MORAL : 
Respect the Hobbies of Husbands...!
😝😆😁👌
Story continues...
Wife now took out HIS Credit card from HER Purse, and swiped! Unfortunately, he had not blocked HIS OWN card...!
Moral: 
Don't underestimate the Power of a WIFE...!
👩😎😁😝😂
Story Still continues...
After swiping, the machine indicated, "Enter OTP Sent To Your Mobile"
Moral: 
When Man tends to Lose, Machine is smart enough to SAVE HIM...!
😀😜👨👍
Story still continues...
When she turned back with Depression, her Mobile rang, showing Forwarded SMS, BY THE Husband:
"Your OTP is ****"
Finally she bought her items and returned back Happily...!!!
